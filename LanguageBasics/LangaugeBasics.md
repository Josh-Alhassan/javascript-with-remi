# Language Basics

## Things to Learn

- Reviewing Syntax
- Working with Data Types
- Working with Flow Control Statement
- Understanding Functions

At the core of every language is a description of how it should work at the most basic level. This description typically defines syntax, operators, data types, and built-in functionality upon which complex solutions can be built.

## Reviewing Syntax

ECMAScript's syntax borrows heavily from C and other C like languages such as Java, and Perl.

### Case Sensitivity

Everything in JavaScript is _case-sensitive_; variables, function names, and operators are all case-sensitive, meaning that a variable named _"test"_ is different from a variable name _Test_.
